Recipe Website
Introduction
Hello, and welcome to my recipe website project! This is a part of my journey through the Odin Project curriculum, where I get to put my HTML skills to the test. The main objective of this project is to build a basic recipe website using HTML.

Project Description
In this project, I will be creating a main index page that serves as the homepage for the recipe website. This page will include links to different recipes. The focus here is on strengthening my HTML skills, so the website's appearance won't be very fancy. However, I'll have the opportunity to enhance its visual appeal by adding CSS in a future stage of the curriculum.

Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate the following skills:

Constructing the structure of webpages using HTML tags and elements.
Creating effective navigation by linking different web pages within the website.
Organizing content and information in a clear and logical manner.
Incorporating semantic HTML to improve accessibility and search engine optimization.
I'm excited to delve into this project and apply what I've learned about HTML so far. It's a great opportunity for me to solidify my understanding of HTML concepts and gain hands-on experience with building a functional website.
